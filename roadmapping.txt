
	Space Raiders
	(Think battleship in space)
	You have an interconnected set of solar systems on the screen. The purpose of the game is to find the other player and destroy their home base.
	
	1. Each player sets their base on the screen
	2. Each player chooses 3 starting troops from a list of options
		a. scout - high rate of travel, average sight distance
		b. depth charge - sends out an emp blast that if detonated within the solar system of someone's troop or base disables that object for 1 round and alerts the sender of what unit was there
		c. destroyer - a slower battle unit with less travel distance but increased fire power
		d. swarm - limited number of moves per swarm but they are able to divide their numbers in half each round and perform a binary search of solar systems for that round
		e. scan - allows the user to select any 3 neigboring solar systems and get feedback as to if there is any enemey presence within. They do not know what vessel or objects are within
		f.
		g.
